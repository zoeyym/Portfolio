						<h3>Roller Coaster Project</h3> 
						<p>In my Physics Honors class, we were assigned to make a roller coaster out of paper at the end of our energy unit. We had to meet certain requirements such as having a loop-the-loop, two turns, a hill, and a funnel. I worked with one of my best friends to create this project and we worked very hard on it. We called it "The Dreamer" and constructed it with blue paper with hints of yellow. We also added white fluff to act as clouds. The entire project took us about half a week to create and we came across many difficulties we had to resolve. Unfortunately, I don't have a picture of the roller coaster we built but I have a slideshow we had to make at the end of the project.</p>

						<h3>French Plat Principal Project</h3> 
						<p>In my French II Honors class, we were assigned to make a presentation on "un plat principal", which is a main dish. I picked to reserach Le Boeuf Bourgignon, which is a famous dish in the region of Bourgogne, France. I created a five-slide presentation that explains all different factors of the dish. I presented a summary of what the dish is, where it's from, all the ingredients needed, a recipe, and even a fun fact. I presented the entire thing in French to practice my speaking and writing. I enjoyed doing this project because french is one of my favorite classes and it was fun to research. We did this project because in this particular unit, we were learning all about foods, appliances, cooking instructions, and etc.
